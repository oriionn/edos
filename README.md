# Edos
Edos is a minimalist service for monitoring the resources used by your server. It features a minimalist interface to make use of the service as easy as possible.

## Installation
### Client
First of all, you need the client, which is the interface you'll use to bring all your servers together.

To install it, go to the [client README](client/README.md).

### Server
Next, you'll need to install a server, which will retrieve information on your server's resources.

To install it, go to the [server's README](server/README.md).
